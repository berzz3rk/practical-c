# Practical C
---
This repository holds every excercise written in the C progrraming language following the Practical C book written by Steve Oualline.

## Chapter by Chapter

### Chapter 1
"Gives a brief description of the C language and its use. This chapter includes some background on the history of the language."


### Chapter 2
"Explains the basic programming proccess and gives you enough information to write a very simple program."

- [Hello World in C](./src/ch02/)

### Chapter 3
"Discusses programming style. Commentig a program is covered, as well as writing clear and simple code."

- [Hello World in C with comments](./src/ch03/)

### Chapter 4
"Introduces you to simple C statements. Basic variables and the assignment statement covered in detail, along with arithmetics operators +, - , * , / and %."

### Chapter 5
"Covers arrays and more complex variables. Shorthand operators such as ++ and %= are also described."

### Chapter 6
"Explains simple decision statements including **if**, **else** and **for**. A discusion of == versus = is presented."

### Chapter 7
"Takes you through all the necessary steps to create a simple program from specification through release. Structured programming, fast prototyping and debugging are also discussed."

### Chapter 8
"Describes additional control statements. Included are **while**,**break** and **continue**.The **switch** statement is discussed in detail."

### Chapter 9
"Introduces local variables, functions and parameters."

### Chapter 10
"Describes the C preprocessor, which gives the programmer tremendous flexibility in writing code. The chapter also provides the programmer with a tremendous number of ways to mess up. Simple rules that help keep the preprocessor from becoming a problem are described."

### Chapter 11
"Discusses the logical C operators that work on bits."

### Chapter 12
"Explains structures and other advanced types. The **sizeof** operator and the **enum** type are included."

### Chapter 13
"Introduces C pointer variables and shows some of their uses."

### Chapter 14
"Describes both buffered and unbuffered input/output. ASCII and binary files are discussed, and you are shown how to construct a simple file."

### Chapter 15
"Describes how to debug a program, as well as how to use an interactive debugger. You are shown not only how to debug a program, but also how to write a program so that it is easy to debug. This chapter also describes many optimization techniques for making for program run faster and more efficiently."

### Chapter 16
"Uses a simple decimal floating-point format to introduce you to the problems inherent in floating point, such as roundoff error, precision loss, overflow and underflow."

### Chapter 17
"Describes advanced uses of pointers for constructing dynamics structures such as linked lists and trees."

### Chapter 18
"Shows how to split a program into several files and use modular programming techniques. The **make** utility is explained in more detail."

### Chapter 19
"Describes the old, pre-ANSI C language and associated compilers. Although such compilers are rare today, a lot of code was written for them and there are still a large number of programs out there that use the old syntax."

### Chapter 20
"Describes the problems that can occur when you port a program (move it from one machine to another)."

### Chapter 21
"Describes the **do**/**while** statement, the , operator and the ? and : operators."

### Chapter 22
"Details the steps necessary to take a complex program from conception to completion. Information-hiding and modular programming techniques are emphasized."

### Chapter 23
"Lists some programming adages that will help you construct good C programs."

### Apendix
"List the octal, hexadecimal and decimal representations of the ASCII character set that is now in almos universal use."
